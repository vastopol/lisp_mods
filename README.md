# lisp_mods
examining modularity of the lisp interpreter

* zero - restricted dialect, basic structure

* one  - procedural data as an abstraction, variable scoping lexical/dynamic

* two  - decomposition of state, side effects as a mechanism

* ex   - examples in scheme

for the most part follows the syntax in the research papers,
however scheme's syntax has changed a little since 1976:
* t -> #t
* numberp -> number?
